Spring Boot Application Properties

Spring Boot application properties/configurations are stored in `application.properties`/`application.yaml` file under the `resources` directory by default. These files can be used to store non Spring related application properties as well. A simple property can be read by the application easily by adding an annotation. If you want to store an Array of properties or a Map, few more annotations might be needed.
